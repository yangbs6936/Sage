# Sage Terminal Boundary

`sage tui` is Sage's terminal-first frontend. The Rust implementation binary is `sage-terminal`, but that binary is an internal launch target rather than the primary user entrypoint.

This document defines what belongs in the Rust TUI layer and what must remain in the CLI/runtime layer.

## TUI Responsibilities

The Rust TUI owns:

- terminal rendering
- input editing and cursor behavior
- popup / overlay / picker interaction
- startup routing for `sage tui ...` arguments after the Python launcher forwards them
- transcript presentation
- local UI state
- mapping structured backend results into terminal-friendly output

The TUI may add convenience entrypoints, but it should not invent new backend behavior.

## CLI / Runtime Responsibilities

The Sage CLI/runtime owns:

- agent orchestration
- provider verification and persistence
- config inspection and config file creation
- session storage and session inspection
- skill discovery and validation
- doctor diagnostics
- backend event generation and JSON schemas

If behavior changes in any of those areas, it should be implemented in the CLI/runtime first and only surfaced through the TUI second.

## Hard Rules

1. The TUI should prefer structured results over human-readable CLI text.
2. The TUI should not parse presentation-oriented stdout when a JSON contract is available.
3. New non-interactive entrypoints should be added to the CLI/runtime first, then exposed through `sage tui`.
4. TUI-only state must stay UI-local. Business state must stay in the runtime.

## What The TUI Currently Depends On

The current TUI contract surface includes:

- `doctor --json`
- `config show --json`
- `config init --json`
- `sessions --json`
- `sessions inspect --json`
- `skills --json`
- `provider list --json`
- `provider inspect --json`
- `provider verify --json`
- `provider create --json`
- `provider update --json`
- `provider delete --json`
- chat/resume streaming events over the existing runtime channel

## What Should Not Be Added To The TUI

Avoid moving these concerns into Rust TUI code:

- provider business rules
- config template logic
- doctor probe implementation
- session persistence logic
- skill resolution logic
- runtime-specific error classification that the CLI can define directly

## Practical Review Guideline

For future PRs:

- if a change only affects rendering or interaction, it belongs in `app/terminal`
- if a change affects runtime meaning or data shape, it belongs in `app/cli` / runtime first
- if the TUI needs a new capability, prefer adding a stable CLI/JSON contract instead of special-casing UI logic
